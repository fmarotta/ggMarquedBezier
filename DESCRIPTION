Description: Draw BÃ©zier curves, parametrized by x, y, xend, yend, angle,
	and strength. The `angle` and `strength` aesthetics determine the
	starting direction (relative to a straight segment), hence the
	amount of curvature. For enhanced flexibility, you may also specify
	`angle_end` and `strength_end` to control the angle at which the curve
	arrives at the endpoint. Optionally, a label can be added at the
	midpoint of the curve, aligning itself with the curve's orientation.
